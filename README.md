# Freifunk-on-low-Flash-or-RAM

## Idea
* Configure image with blockmount and the needed packages as modules
* Compile Freifunk Gluon
* Boot the small image and prepare USB Stick
* Boot again and install the remaining packages

## Prerequisits
* "Old" router where openwrt can be installed
* USB Stick, formatted with ext4

## Forewords
The instruction is not complete and may have some errors. The installtion itself is very tricky. 
Images for different router and/or packages will not be provided and has to be self-compiled.
The whole process can take several hours. The whole instruction and process is just a proof of concept to install Freifunk on old hardware, but is not supported.
